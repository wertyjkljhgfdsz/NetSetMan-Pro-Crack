# NetSetMan-Pro-Crack

This network settings manager can easily switch between 5 different, visually structured profiles. It is valuable and practical and easy, and intuitive to handle. The entry fields remind me of the Windows "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties," but filling in the addresses is much easier.
